	abstract = {Linear mixed models have attracted considerable recent attention as a powerful and effective tool for accounting for population stratification and relatedness in genetic association tests. However, existing methods for exact computation of standard test statistics are computationally impractical for even moderate-sized genome-wide association studies. To deal with this several approximate methods have been proposed. Here, we present an efficient exact method that makes these approximations unnecessary in many settings. This method is roughly n times faster than the widely-used exact method EMMA, where n is the sample size, making exact genome-wide association analysis computationally practical for large numbers of individuals.},
